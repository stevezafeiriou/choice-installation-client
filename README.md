## Introduction

The Choice Installation Application is a React.js app that interacts with a backend server to display generative artworks created by the connected "Choice" interactive sculpture (ESP32-S3 microcontroller). It connects to a socket server to receive real-time updates of pixel art and acceleration data, stores the data, and provides QR codes for saving and validating the artworks. This application also includes an information display for showcasing a gallery of previously generated artworks.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saphirelabs/choice-installation-client.git
   cd choice-installation-client
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add the following environment variables:

   ```env
   BROWSER=none
   REACT_APP_LOCAL_IP=
   REACT_APP_API_ENDPOINT=
   REACT_APP_APP_DOMAIN=
   ```

   These environment variables define the base URLs for the backend API. Ensure these are correctly set to avoid exposing sensitive data.

4. Build the React app:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Usage

To run the app in development mode, use:

```bash
npm start
```

To view the app in production, upload the built files to your server and navigate to `https://your-app-domain.com`.
